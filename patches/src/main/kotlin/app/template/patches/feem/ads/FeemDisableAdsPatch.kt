// Verified against Feem 6.10.0 (versionCode 6010000).
//
// Architecture: Capacitor/Angular hybrid app. Premium logic lives in JS (main.js).
// Ad serving is done by the @capacitor-community/admob native plugin (classes3.dex).
// The JS calls these three @PluginMethod entry-points on the Java AdMob class:
//   - prepareInterstitial() — loads an interstitial ad
//   - showInterstitial()    — displays it
//   - showBanner()          — shows a banner ad
//
// Blocking these three methods at the native layer suppresses all AdMob ads
// regardless of what the JS layer requests. PluginCall.resolve() is called so
// the JS promise resolves cleanly (no error thrown, no retry loop).
//
// The premium (isPro) gate is server-side via backend5.feem.io license response;
// a client-side bypass is not feasible for that feature.
